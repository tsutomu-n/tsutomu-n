# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a seasoned construction supervisor and a certified construction management engineer, juggling the worlds of construction and IT. I'm passionate about systematizing knowledge in the construction industry and currently working on creating operation manuals for all departments in my company. 🏗️💻

### 🔭 Mission

I'm on a mission to enrich the chronically understaffed construction industry by automating tasks and sharing technical information through a website I'm building.

### 🌱 Learning

I'm a lifelong learner and researcher, always curious and ready to dive deep into any topic that catches my interest.

### 👨‍🍳 Interests

In my free time, I love to create - be it DIY projects or cooking up a storm in the kitchen.

### 💬 Open for Discussion

Ask me about anything related to construction, IT, or how to maintain a healthy lifestyle while juggling desk work and field work.

### ⚡ Philosophy

I never judge a book by its cover. I believe in experiencing things first hand before forming an opinion.
