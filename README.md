## Hello there! 👋 

#### I'm a seasoned construction supervisor and the lone IT professional at my company, diving headfirst into programming to streamline our office tasks.

## Here's what I'm up to:

- 🔨 **Construction Knowledge Organization:** Wrestling with ways to better organize and understand our field's vast knowledge base.
- 💻 **Lone IT Warrior and Programming:** As the sole IT professional at my company, I'm turning my journey into programming into a tool for increasing efficiency.
- 📘 **User Manuals:** I'm the author of manuals for every department in our company, ensuring everyone has the info they need.
- 🚀 **Boosting the Industry:** I'm on a mission to energize our understaffed industry, spreading knowledge and illuminating the craftsmanship handed down through generations.
- 🤖 **Task Automation:** I'm developing systems to automate tasks and make our work even more efficient.
- 🌐 **Web Application Creation:** Building web applications is my current interest and challenge.
- 🖋 **Tech Blogging:** Stay tuned for my upcoming blog with technical articles on all things construction and IT.
